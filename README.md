# loghub
Loghub maintains a collection of system logs, which are freely accessible for research purpose. Some of the logs are production data released from previous studies, some others are collected from real systems in our lab environment. Wherever possible, the logs are NOT sanitized, anonymized or modified in any way. All these logs amount to XX GB in size. We host only a small sample (2k lines) on Github for each dataset, please contact us if you are interested in the raw logs.
